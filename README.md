This repository holds supportive code and documents for my master's thesis. 

In my master's thesis, we created, analyzed, and numerically tested a cut finite element method using H-div elements for the Stokes interface problem. My supervisor was Sara Zahedi at KTH University. 

Sara's team created a [C++ repository](https://github.com/CutFEM/CutFEM-Library) for simulating cut finite element problems. I used this code base to do the numerical experiments, and I included my main file that uses this code.
